# C# Projects

 These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework
 
- ### Car Insurance
 
 This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
 on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is an admin page 
 that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
 
 - ### Student database
 
 This is an Basic Entity Framework Code-First app that creates a basic Student database and adds student and subjects. 
 Still work in progress...
